# CMPE 331 Project Cycle Work Distribution

## Rough To-Do List

### Interface Visibility of Program (for Customer)
* Authentication Login System
* Student, Teacher, Parent (Can be regarded as different parts)
* Design


### Functionality and Database of Program (Methods and such)
* Student, Teacher, Parent (Again Can be regarded as different parts)
* Methods and algorithm analysis of whats required
* Test cases (should be in parallel with actual coding)


### Aftermath and Other Work
* Presentation (it is specified that each person must present 1 part of documentation)
* Documentation
* Project Report will be done with LATEX (look to actual project pdf for more info)
* Pre-Code analysis 

## Resources and Libraries that will be used
Github Repository to track progress and fast accessibility
Java spring for the data storage and general back-end of the program
ReactJS for front end design (Check out grommet aswell)
HTML, CSS for front end also
MySql for database
